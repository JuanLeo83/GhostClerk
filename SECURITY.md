# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability in GhostClerk, please report it privately to the maintainers so we can address it before disclosing publicly.

- Email: `juanleodev@gmail.com`
- Please include: description, steps to reproduce, impact, and any PoC if available.

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and provide timelines for remediation.

## Disclosure
Do not publicly disclose a vulnerability before the maintainers have had a reasonable time to patch it. After a fix is released, we will coordinate disclosure and credit.
